JVM(java Virtual Machine)
--------------------------
JVM is part of JRE

JVM Memory
    Method Area-- Heap--- JVM Language Stack-- PC register-- Native Method Stack

    Method Area(PermGen):- Class related info. class name ,
                    parent class name, method, member variable , static varible
                    Its a shared resource. Method area is also term as perm space.
    Heap:-  Object . Shared Resource
    Stack :-  Thread specific  variable .
    PC register :- address of next instruction to execute
    Native method stack: stack native method

    note:- static variable is part of MethodArea(permGen) as it is part of class not instance.


Classloader
    Classloader is responsible for loading class at runtime.

    There are three level of classloader:-
        1. BootStrap classloader written in native code.
            load core class from /jre/lib
        2. Extension classloader
            path:- /jre/lib/ext
                or from java.ext.dirs system properties
        3. System/application classloader
                from classPath

Execution Engine
    1. Interpreter
    2. JIT compiler(Just in time)
    3. Garbage Collector

    Interpreter
        Byte code is interpreter into native code. Disadvantage: if same method is called multiple times
                interpreter will be called each time
    JIT
         Store the native code after interpretation. so same method is called multiple time. interpreter will run once.

    Garbage Collector
        1. Serial Collector  :- Single Thread. STW(stop the world)
        2. Parallel collector:- Multiple Thread . Default Collector
        3. CMS(concurrent mark and sweep)  - In addition to parallel collector. It runs in parallel with application.
            STW is called while initialization and change in Heap State. Full GC run in concurrent with application.
        4. G1 Collector(garbage first)
            Suitable for Heap Size greater than 4GB.
