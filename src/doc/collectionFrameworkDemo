Legacy collection
    -Arrays, Vector, HashTables

Collection Interface
        List
        Set
        Queue
        Map

List Interface
        - ArrayList
        - LinkedList
        - Vector
    Order list, duplicates allowed

Set Interface
        - HashSet
        - LinkedHashSet
        - TreeHashSet
    UnOrder List, no Duplicates
    Set only contain key

Queue
        - PriorityQueue
        - LinkedList
     FIFO

Map
        - HashTable
        - HashMap
        - LinkedHashMap
        - TreeMap
      pair(Key, value)


Iterators
    Used in Collection Framework to retrieve element one by one.
      - Enumeration
                    Enumeration is used in legacy Collection to retrieve element
                    Enumeration is only for legacy class(vector,hashTable) only
                    Enumeration can't be used for removal operation.
      - Iterator
                    Iterator is universal , can applied to any Collection.
                    Removal operation is supported.
                    Addition/Replacement operation can't done.
                    Only forward direction iterating is possible.
      - ListIterator
                    Only available for List implementing class like linkedList, arrayList.
                    It provides bi-direction iteration.

                    Addition/Removal/Replacement operation is supported.
                    Both backward and forward direction iterating is possible.
