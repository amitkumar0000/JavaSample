RxJava : Reactive Extension Java

Building block of RxJava
1. Observable :
        It is source of data
        It start providing data once subscriber start observing Observables.

2. Subscribers/Observers :
        listening to Observable
        If new item is emitted, onNext method is called on each subscriber
        if observable finish data flow successfully, onComplete is called on each subscriber.
        if observable finish data flow with error, onError is called on each subscriber.

set of method for modifying and composing the data.

An Observable emits data and subscriber consume data.


Different ways to create Observable Object

1. Observable observable = Observable.create(new ObservableOnSubscribe(){})
2. Observable observable = Observable.just();
2. Observable observable = Observable.fromCallable(new Callable{})

Hot and Cold Observable; connectAble Observable

Hot Observable : will emits data as available, don't wait for subscriber.
                They don't emit sequence of data again for new subscriber.


Cold Observable : will emits data if subscribe
                  if more than one subscriber than emits data one by one to all subscriber.


RxSubjects : It acts as both observables and subscriber as well.
             RxSubject are Hot Observables.

Ways to create Hot Observables
      1. Subjects :- Using Subject , we can not only convert cold observable into hot observable. but
                     can also create hot observable from scratch.
      2. ConnectAbleObservable : we can only convert cold observable into hot observable using publish and connect method.
                              and various variant like refCount, autoConnect and replay etc.
