A collections is group of individual object represented as single unit.

java.util.collection and java.util.map are two main root interface of java Collections Classes.

Legacy collection : Array, vector and hashTable

Collection
============
        -- List
        -- Set
            --SortedSet
        -- Queue
        -- Dequeue

Map
    -- SortedMap

Set:- Doesn't allow duplicates.Elements are unordered
        HashSet(Hashing based), LinkedHashSet, TreeSet(Balanced Tree)

List:- Allow duplicates and in ordered way
        ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector , Stack
        Vector is synchronized ,
        ArrayList is not synchronized. IT can be synchronized using Collections.SynchronizedList(list)
            and CopyOnWriteArrayList()

Queue:- order elements in FIFO
        PriorityQueue

Deque:-  Allow LIFO and FIFO
         ArrayDeque,LinkedList(Deque)

Map:-   Contains key value pairs. Don't allow duplicates.
        HashMap, LinkedHashMap, HashTable,TreeMap


Iterator, Enumeration, ListIterators
=====================================
All above are used to retrieve elements from Collections.

Iterator are universal Iterator, can be used by any collections.
Enumeration only work with legacy collection(HashTable, Vector)
ListIterator is only for class that implements List interface.

Iterators only allow forward direction elements retrieval .no add, modify is allowed. Removal is allowed
With ListIterator both forward and backward direction, element retrieval is allowed. Elements can be modified, add and removed.
