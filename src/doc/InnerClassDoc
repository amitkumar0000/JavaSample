            2) Method Local inner classes
            3) Anonymous inner classes
            4) Static nested classes


    Static class
        Static class has access to static member of enclosing class.
        The object of static class can be created without enclosing class object.
        As  EnclosingClassName.StaticClassName obj = new EnclosingClassName.StaticClassName()

        Static Class should not be created within block else it will give compilation error.

    Local Inner Class
        Local inner class are defined inside a block and has scope within block,
        Local inner class must be instantiated within the block it define

        Till Java 7 Local inner class can access only final local variable of enclosing class.
        From java 8 non-final local variable of enclosing data can also be access.

        Local class can extend abstract class or implements interface

        Local inner class can't be declared static if defined with method , if blocks,

        Local Inner class can't have static Method.


    Anonymous Inner Class
        Anonymous inner class can be specified in two ways:
            1. As subclass of specified type.
            2. As implementer of the specified interface
